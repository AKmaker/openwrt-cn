### OpenWrt Customization

OpenWrt is a GNU/Linux distribution targeting router-like embedded devices: it is the perfect choice to use as the "brain" of our Wi-Fi Car.

The device we chose is the [TP-Link WR703N](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr703n) â€“ a pocket-size router with reasonable price tag. However, you may use any OpenWrt-compatible router with a USB interface to do the job.

The WR703N has only 4MB of flash ROM, meaning you must be very careful with your software selection.

Pre-compiled images are available on our [downloads](http://www.open-drone.org/resources) page.

### Getting the Source
