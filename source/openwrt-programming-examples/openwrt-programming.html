	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	I'm writing this document because I found the documentation available
	on the OpenWrt wiki (http://wiki.openwrt.org) difficult to follow.  I
	found myself in the position of wanting to compile a very simple
	program that I could run on my OpenWrt router.  I ended up
	spending hours wading through the frustratingly incomplete
	documentation on the wiki, going through dozens of forum posts, and
	conducting extensive trial-and-error before my code would compile.  
	I especially appreciated the examples on the wiki that contain the
	warning: "Note this Makefile is provided as an example only; it
	will not compile."  If something doesn't work, it isn't a very
	good example, is it?   Here, then, is a (hopefully) more
	straightforward guide to building a program for OpenWrt.  I found
	that existing documentation focuses more on porting existing,
	complicated programs to OpenWrt.  My intention is to focus on getting
	a small, very simple, home-grown application running on OpenWrt.  My
	goal is to explain this in as simple and complete a manner  as
	possible, explaining each and every step necessary to write and
	compile a program that will run on OpenWrt. The process is actually
	very simple and straightforward -- provided you know what you're doing.
	For the purposes of this tutorial I'm going to assume you have a development
       	box running linux and a router running OpenWrt.  I will also assume you are at least
	somewhat familiar with C/C++ and standard Unix Makefiles.</p>

	<p>The code for the examples in this tutorial can be downloaded from 
	<a href="openwrt-programming-examples.tar.gz">here.</a> The example 
	from the first part of the tutorial is in the 
	<strong>openwrt-programming-examples/c</strong> directory and the 
	example for the White Russian portion of the second part is in 
	the <strong>openwrt-programming-examples/c++</strong> directory. 
	The modified Kamikaze SDK Makefile referred to in part III is also
	included in this zip file.</p>



	<br /><br /><br />
	<h3 id="part1">Part I: A Simple Program in C</h3>
	
	<p>
	First, we're going to need to write the code for the program itself
	and get it compiling on our local linux machine.  Let's write a
	simple "hello world" program that we want to run on the
	router:
	</p>
	
	
	
	<br><font face="monospace"><strong>~/helloworld/src/helloworld.c:</strong></font>
	<br>
	<table bgcolor="tan" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><pre>/****************
* Helloworld.c
* The most simplistic C program ever written.
* An epileptic monkey on crack could write this code.
*****************/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hell! O' world, why won't my code compile?\n\n");
	return 0;
}
	</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

	
	<p>Alright, we have our code.  Note
	the location of this file.  Make a <strong>helloworld</strong> directory and
	then a <strong>src </strong>subdirectory.  Place the code in the <strong>src</strong>
	subdirectory. Now, let's write a standard Unix Makefile to compile
	this code for us:  </p>

	<br><font face="monospace"><strong>~/helloworld/src/Makefile:</strong></font>
	<br>
	<table bgcolor="tan" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><pre># build helloworld executable when user executes "make"
helloworld: helloworld.o
	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) helloworld.o -o helloworld
helloworld.o: helloworld.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c helloworld.c

# remove object files and executable when user executes "make clean"
clean:
	rm *.o helloworld
	</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

	<p>Notice that instead of hard-coding "gcc" in the makefile to
	compile the program, we use a variable that holds the C compiler,
	$(CC).   If you're compiling a c++ program you would use $(CXX)
	instead of $(CC) and $(CXXFLAGS) instead of $(CFLAGS). The use of the
	compiler variable is not necessary to compile the code locally, but
	in order to compile the code for OpenWRT it is critical because we
	won't be using the standard gcc compiler.  Place the makefile in the
	same <strong>src</strong> directory our code is in.  We can now go to the <strong>src</strong>
	directory, type "make" and the program should compile. You
	can run it by typing "./helloworld"</p>

	<p>Be sure to run  "make clean" to remove the compiled binary 
	and object files after you have successfully tested the program.  
	We're going to build the source files in this directory for
	the router, and if the old object file isn't deleted, it
	will be used instead of the new one we need to generate that
	is compatible with OpenWrt.</p>


	<table bgcolor="black" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/helloworld/src$ make
cc -c helloworld.c
cc helloworld.o -o helloworld
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/helloworld/src$ ./helloworld
Hell! O' world, why won't my code compile?

mockingbird@linuxbox:~/helloworld/src$ make clean
rm *.o helloworld
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/helloworld/src$ 
	</font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>



	<p>So far this should be a review on how to write simple C programs and how
	to use Makefiles.  Now comes the tricky part, compiling the code so
	that it will run on our router.  The router uses a distinctly
	different architecture than our linux development box. Because there
	isn't enough memory/disk space on the router to install a compiler
	and compile the code natively, we need to "cross-compile"
	the code on our development box for use on the router.  To do this we
	need a special compiler and development environment called the
	OpenWRT SDK.  You can download the SDK from
	<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org">http://downloads.openwrt.org</a>
	The SDK varies depending on the architecture of your development
	box, the architecture of your router and the version/release of
	OpenWrt your router is running.  I currently have whiterussian v0.9
	installed on my Linksys WRT54G router, and my development box is an
	i686, so the SDK I use is 
	<a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/whiterussian/0.9/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1.tar.bz2">this one</a>.
	Extract the SDK files from the downloaded archive, and enter the
	SDK directory, which should have the same name as the tar.bz2 file 
	(in my case OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1).</p>
	
	
	<table bgcolor="black" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
mockingbird@linuxbox:~$ tar xfj OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1.tar.bz2
mockingbird@linuxbox:~$ cd OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1$ ls
dl  docs  examples  include  Makefile  package  README.SDK  rules.mk  scripts  staging_dir_mipsel
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1$ 
	</font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>	
	
	
	<p>Our goal is to build a package for OpenWrt using the source we already
	have.  When you execute the "make" command in the SDK
	directory, the SDK will compile all properly configured packages in
	the <strong>package</strong> subdirectory under the SDK directory.  The next
	step (and the trickiest) is to properly configure our code so that
	the SDK will build it.  First, copy the <strong>helloworld </strong>directory
	we made earlier into the <strong>package</strong> subdirectory of the SDK:</p>
	
	<table bgcolor="black" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1$ cp -r ~/helloworld package
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1$ 
	</font></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>	

	<p>In order to tell the OpenWrt SDK how to build our program we need to
	create a special Makefile in the <strong>helloworld</strong> directory, above
	the <strong>src</strong> directory which contains our conventional makefile. 
	Writing this file is 90% of the work involved in compiling our
	program for OpenWrt.  Below is an OpenWrt makefile for building the
	helloworld program.  Each section is heavily commented so that it
	should be fairly clear what is going on:</p>
	
	<br><font face="monospace"><strong>~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/helloworld/Makefile:</strong></font>

# This is NOT the default.  The default uses the PKG_SOURCE_URL and the

# The defaults are appropriate for compiling a simple program such as this one


# Specify where and how to install the program. Since we only have one file, 
# the helloworld executable, install it by copying it to the /bin directory on
# the router. The $(1) variable represents the root directory on the router running 
# OpenWrt. The $(INSTALL_DIR) variable contains a command to prepare the install 
# directory if it does not already exist.  Likewise $(INSTALL_BIN) contains the 
# command to copy the binary file from its current location (in our case the build
# directory) to the install directory.

	<p>As indicated, most OpenWrt make files specify how to download the source
	of an application from a URL, and most documentation assumes that you
	want to do this.  However, if you're building your own application
	from scratch it doesn't make sense to download from a URL.  It's much
	simpler to have the source locally and use the Build/Prepare section
	to copy the source to the build directory, as shown above.  Also, be
	<em>very</em> careful of spacing in the Makefile.  The indentation under the define
	sections should be tabs, not spaces and there should be no
	whitespace at the end of lines that are not comments.  The trailing
	whitespace can be a problem when variables are being defined, as the
	compiler may think there is a space at the end of a directory name. If
	we're copying something to <strong>dir_with_trailing_space/subdir</strong>
	the copy command may be executed as "cp my.file dir_with_trailing_space  /subdir".
	Not only don't you want anything in <strong>/subdir</strong>, you probably
	dont have permission to create it and write to it.</p>

	<p>Also note that the syntax for specifying the description is slightly different
	between the White Russian and Kamikaze versions of the SDK.  The build system
	in Kamikaze requires that you specify the description using a seperate section
	so delete the description variable in the Package/helloworld section and uncomment
	the kamikaze description section above as indicated.</p>
	
	<p>Now we're all set to compile the helloworld package.  Go to the 
	root SDK directory (if you're not already there) and type "make
	V=99"  The "V=99" option is optional, but it is useful 
	for debugging as it instructs the compiler to be "verbose" 
	and output all the details of what it is doing.</p>

	<p>Now that you have a simple program compiling, you can start expanding on it
	to do whatever you want. If you run into problems I suggest you browse
	existing package Makefiles to see if someone else has done something
	similar to what you are trying to do. You can browse the files for
	these packages <a href="https://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/packages/">here</a>.
	If you still have problems, browse the posts on the 
	<a href="http://forum.openwrt.org/viewforum.php?id=2">developer forum</a>
	to see if anyone else has had a similar problem. If not, post your
	problem to the forum with a detailed explanation of what you're trying
	to do, your OpenWrt Makefile and the errors you're getting. Hopefully,
	some experienced developer will be kind enough to help out. Please do 
	<em><strong>not</strong></em>email me personally if you have a problem 
	with your code. If, however, you believe there is an error or serious 
	omission in this tutorial, please let me know. I am relatively new to 
	working with OpenWrt and it is certainly possible that I've made a 
	mistake somewhere in this document. I have, however, personally tested 
	all code included here on my own setup, and made every effort to be as 
	accurate as possible.</p>

	<p>Good luck with your programming!</p>

	<br /></br /></br />
	<h3 id="part2" >Part II: C++ and the Standard Template Library (STL)</h3>

	<p>If you only want to compile C programs, the first part of my tutorial should be enough to get you started.  However,
	if you want to use C++ there is another issue you're likely to run into. Let's say we want to compile the following
	C++ program for OpenWrt:</p>

	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/helloworld/src/helloworld.cpp:</strong></font>
	<br />

	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
/****************
* Helloworld.cpp
*****************/
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string s = "Hell! O' world, why won't my c++ code run?\n\n";
	cout &lt;&lt; s;
	return 0;
}
	</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>So, let's do exactly as we did before and see what happens. We just have to update the 
	compiler flags in the  Makefile to indicate that we're using a C++ compiler instead of 
	a C compiler, right?<p>

	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/helloworld/src/Makefile:</strong></font>
	<br /><font face="monospace" color ="red">NOTE: This code will compile but not run, further modifications are needed which are described below</font>
	<br />
	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
# build helloworld executable when user executes "make"
helloworld: helloworld.o
	$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) helloworld.o -o helloworld
helloworld.o: helloworld.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c helloworld.cpp

# remove object files and executable when user executes "make clean"
clean:
	rm *.o helloworld
	</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>If you use the exact same OpenWrt Makefile as before, this program will compile 
	just fine.  It will even install properly when you copy the helloworld_1_mipsel.ipk 
	file to the router and type "ipkg install helloworld_1_mipsel.ipk"   However, watch 
	what happens if you try to run the program:</p>

	<table border=1 bgcolor="black"><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
root@OpenWrt:~# helloworld
helloworld: can't load library 'libstdc++.so.6'
root@OpenWrt:~#
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>			

	<p>So, what went wrong?  The problem is that this program uses strings and iostreams 
	which are a feature of the C++ standard template library (STL).  However, because memory 
	is so critical in an embedded application like OpenWrt, the standard template library is 
	not available by default.<p>
      
	<p>What needs to be done to fix the problem depends on which version of OpenWrt you are running.
	If you are running <em>Kamikaze</em>, the problem is much easier to fix than if you are running 
	<em>White Russian</em>. If you are running <em>Kamikaze</em>, you only need to install the 
	<strong>libstdcpp</strong> library.  If you are running <em>White Russian</em>, as I am, you must install
	the <strong>uclibcxx</strong> library, as well as make certain changes to the Makefiles to use this library, which
	is a special implementation of the standard library for embedded devices. If you are running
	<em>Kamikaze</em> follow the first part of the following instructions to install <strong>libstdcpp</strong>
	instead of <strong>uclibcxx</strong>, and ignore the changes to the Makefiles.  If you are running
	<em>White Russian</em>, you can follow these directions exactly.  Note that example files for this portion of
	the tutorial assume you are running <em>White Russian</em>, and will not work with <em>Kamikaze</em>.</p>
     		
	
	<p>Before we adjust our Makefiles to use to this alternate library, let's first make sure that 
	it's installed on the router so that it is available to link to.  Log into your router.  Then, 
	make sure your list of packages is up to date by using the &quot;ipkg update&quot; command:</p> 
	
	<table border=1 bgcolor="black"><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg update
Downloading http://downloads.openwrt.org/backports/0.9/Packages
Updated list of available packages in /usr/lib/ipkg/lists/0.9-backports

Successfully terminated.
root@OpenWrt:~# 
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>
	
	
	<p>Once you have updated your package list, install uclibcxx by typing &quot;ipkg 
	install uclibcxx&quot;  If you do not have uclibcxx installed this should install it:</p>

	<table border=1 bgcolor="black"><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg install uclibcxx
Installing uclibcxx (0.2.1-1) to root...

root@OpenWrt:~# 
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>Otherwise, if the library is already installed, you'll see this confirmation:</p>

	<table border=1 bgcolor="black"><tr><td><pre><font color="white">
root@OpenWrt:~# ipkg install uclibcxx
Package uclibcxx (0.2.1-1) installed in root is up to date.
Nothing to be done
Successfully terminated.
root@OpenWrt:~# 
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>Now it's time to modify the Makefiles.  First, the one in the src directory.  Only a small 
	change is necessary here, to the line where we link the objects together.  We need to be able 
	to tell the linker to link to another library, and the way we do that is by defining a variable 
	called $(LIBS).  The variable will be defined in the special OpenWrt Makefile, but will be used 
	here, so we need to add it to the end of the line which specifies how to do the linking:</p>

	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/package/helloworld/src/Makefile:</strong></font>
	<br />
	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
# build helloworld executable when user executes "make"
helloworld: helloworld.o
	$(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) helloworld.o -o helloworld <strong>$(LIBS)</strong>
helloworld.o: helloworld.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c helloworld.cpp

# remove object files and executable when user executes "make clean"
clean:
	rm *.o helloworld
	</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>The OpenWrt Makefile needs a slightly more complex modification.  Recall the comment I placed in the 
	OpenWrt Makefile we used before, &quot;We do not need to define Build/Configure or Build/Compile 
	directives.  The defaults are appropriate for compiling a simple program such as this one.&quot;  
	Well, guess what?  In order to link to uclibcxx we need to customize how we're going to compile the 
	program, and we're going to do this in the Build/Compile directive.  Before we re-define this directive 
	to suit our purposes, let's see what the default looks like:</p>

	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>TAKEN FROM: ~/OpenWrt-SDK-Linux-i686-1/include/package.mk:</strong></font>
	<br />
	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
define Build/Compile/Default
	CFLAGS="$(TARGET_CFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CPPFLAGS) " \
	LDFLAGS="$(EXTRA_LDFLAGS) " \
	$(MAKE) -C $(PKG_BUILD_DIR) \
		$(TARGET_CONFIGURE_OPTS) \
		CROSS="$(TARGET_CROSS)" \
		CXXFLAGS="$(TARGET_CFLAGS) $(EXTRA_CPPFLAGS) " \
		ARCH="$(ARCH)" \
		$(1);
endef
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>
	
	<p>This code specifies the make command (the third line) and a bunch of flags and parameters for 
	compilation.  In order to link to <strong>uclibcxx</strong> or, <strong>uClibc++</strong> as it is
	known to the linker, we add the definition of the $(LIBS) variable as 
	&quot;-nodefaultlibs -lgcc -lc -luClibc++&quot; Also, we need to specify "-nostdinc++" in the
	compiler flags to tell the compiler that c++ standard template library functions and data
	structures will be linked to in specified external libraries and not the standard libraries:</p>

	<h3 id="part3">PART III: Building and Using the Kamikaze SDK </h3>

	<p>The OpenWrt SDK for Kamikaze is available only for 64 bit processors.  If you're one of us mere mortals
	who posesses only one of those antique 32 bit processors, you have a problem.  You can sometimes get away with
	using the White Russian SDK if you only need your program to run on the MIPS architecture, but the new architectures
	supported only by Kamikaze require you to use a Kamikaze SDK.  The solution is to compile the SDK
	yourself.  This is actually fairly simple, provided you have a couple of gigabytes of disk space and an hour or two
	to spare.
	</p>

	<p>First, download the source from <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/7.09/kamikaze_7.09.tar.bz2">here</a>.
	Note, that the preceeding link references Kamikaze version 7.09, which is the latest version as I write this.  You may
	wish to check <a href="http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze">downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze</a> to see if there is a more
	recent version. Once you've dowloaded the source, extract the files and enter the kamikaze build directory:
	</p>

Config.in    include  Makefile  README   scripts   toolchain
mockingbird@linuxbox:~/kamikaze_7.09$ 
	</font></pre></td></tr></table>


	<p>In order to specify the architecture of the router and to specify that we want 
	to build the SDK, we need to run "make menuconfig"</p>


	<table border=1 bgcolor="black"><tr><td><pre><font color="white">

	<p>Now, make sure you have at least 1.5 GB of disk space and a good book (I recommend 
	<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/imageviewer.asp?ean=9780553103540">this</a>,

	because this step is going to take a while. (~90 minutes on my 2.5 Ghz machine with 1 GB of RAM).
	Just run make: </p>

	<p>That's all there is to compiling the SDK  The SDK tar.bz2 file is now in the bin subdirectory.  You can install
	it just as I describe above for the White Russian SDK that can be downloaded in its compiled form.</p>

	<p>However, if you are working with Kamikaze 7.09 (the latest as of this writing) or before, you're likely to have trouble 
	compiling packages with your newly compiled SDK.  There's a bug in the Makefile in the root build directory.  A fix
	has been added to the svn repository, but is not in any release yet.  A description of the problem, (now patched) can
	be found <a href="https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/2508">here</a>.  To quickly fix this defect, extract the SDK directory and then
	edit the Makefile in the extracted root SDK directory.  Open the file with your favorite editor and replace this code:</p>
	
	
	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>Excerpt from ~/kamikaze-sdk/Makefile (Broken):</strong></font>
	<br />
	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
world: FORCE
	$(MAKE) package/compile
	-( \
		cd package; \
		find . -maxdepth 2 -name Config.in | \
			sed -e 's,/Config.in,,g' | \
			xargs -n1 $(MAKE) compile -C; \
	)
	</pre></td></tr></table></font>

	<p>With this, fixed, code:</p>

	<br /><font face="monospace"><strong>Excerpt from ~/kamikaze-sdk/Makefile (Fixed):</strong></font>
	<br />
	<table border=1 bgcolor=tan><tr><td><pre>
world: FORCE
	$(MAKE) package/compile
	-( \
		cd package; \
		for configfile in `find . -maxdepth 2 -name Config.in` ; do \
			$(MAKE) compile -C `dirname $$configfile` ; \
		done \
	)
	</pre></td></tr></table>

	<p>You should now be able to compile your code just as you did with the White Russian SDK.</p>

	<p>I toyed with the idea of <em>not</em> reiterating, for a third time, that I only wish to be contacted if you find a problem
	with this tutorial, but given the number of people who have ignored my first two pleas, I decided better of it.  I would also like
	to say that if you do need to contact me, it would be best to compose your message in English as opposed to l33t speak.  I do not
	in any way mean to disparage those of you for whom English is not your first language by this statement, but merely those who have
	sent me messages containg more numeric and puctuation characters than alphabetic ones.  Finally, Some of you have
	also seen fit to ask for my help in exchange for money.  Admittedly, I am not entirely opposed to this idea. However, if you really
	are interested in hiring me, please offer me a figure with at least three digits in it.  Thank you.</p>
